### Synopsis
Sentiment Analysis using three classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Ensemble Classifier and Neural Network on the text data. 

### Tech

* [Python](https://pythonprogramminglanguage.com) - build machine learning algorithms!
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org)- open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents.

### Installation

Sentiment Analysis of the text data requires  [Python](https://pythonprogramminglanguage.com) v3+ to run.

Install the dependencies or packages by using the following command:
!pip install "package_name" in a cell of the .ipynb file
For Example:
```sh

$ pip install wordcloud
$ pip install gensim
$ pip install tensorflow
```
### Packages
The following are the necessary packages to run the python Source code

 matplotlib<br>
*pandas<br>
*nltk<br>
*RE<br>
*loggin<br>
*tensorflow<br>
*gensim<br>
*numpy<br>
*sklearn<br>


### Execution
- Download the  necessary input data files such as labeled_data.csv, unlabeled_data.csv and test_data.csv and keep them in the same directory as the implementation .ipynb file
- Import all the necessary packages and libraries
- Proceed running further cells in the .ipynb file

### Output
- The output from the Python source code would be the "predict_label.csv" stored in the same directory
